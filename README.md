IntToEnglish

This repository contains my solution to the challenge of

converting an Int into its worded representation in the english language.

I decided to use primarily basic resources for this implementation.

The function intToEnglish returns a string with the english

representation of your chosen int.



You can test this by cloning the repository compiling it,

and providing a commandline argument.
